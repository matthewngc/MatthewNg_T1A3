#Create Minesweeper board
#Place mines randomly on the board

#Play the game
#User enters a coordinate on the board
#If the user hits a mine, the game is over
#If the user hits an empty spot:
#   If there are mines around the spot, show the number of mines around the spot
#   If there are no mines around the spot, keep digging until it reaches a spot which is adjacent to mines
